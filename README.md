# 389ds / FreeIPA Exporter

> forked from terrycain/389ds_exporter
---
__It listens on port 9496 by default__

Started out as just a replication status exporter, and evolved to export more FreeIPA related objects.

Is my first stab at go, it works but it could be better and I hope to improve it. The main thing is that it has a loop that
hits LDAP and performs the queries, it doesn't query LDAP when /metrics is queried. What I want is to query LDAP when /metrics
is hit and then cache for a period of time (incase multiple prometheus are running).

To run:
```bash
./389ds_exporter [flags]
```

### Flags

```bash
./389ds_exporter --help
```

* __`-debug`:__ Debug logging
* __`-interval`:__ Scrape interval (default 1m0s)
* __`-ipa-domain`:__ FreeIPA domain e.g. example.org
* __`-ldap.addr`:__ Address of 389ds server (default "localhost:389")
* __`-ldap.pass`:__ 389ds Directory Manager password
* __`-ldap.user`:__ 389ds Directory Manager user (default "cn=Directory Manager")
* __`-log-json`:__ JSON formatted log messages
* __`-web.listen-address`:__ Bind address for prometheus HTTP metrics server (default ":9496")
* __`-web.telemetry-path`:__ Path to expose metrics on (default "/metrics")

### Credits

This repo essentially started off as a clone of the openldap_exporter modified to query
some FreeIPA DNs. The openldap_exporter was a great help in getting this started, as was
the consul_exporter which served as a great reference on how to package a prometheus
exporter.
